# desktop_tools
A set of desktop tools using Python 3.6 and PyQt5.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
To be able to run these files, you will need Python 3.6. You can check your Python version by typing 
```python --version```
in the command line.
In case you don't have this version of Python installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need SIP and PyQt5, which you can install by typing 
```pip install sip```
and 
```pip install qtpy5```

### Contributing
For developing this project, I am using PyCharm Community edition on Mac and Windows. PyCharm will allow you to easily reference PyQt via File > Settings > setuptools > PyQt5
In case you would like to learn more about using Python and Qt to delevop native-looking desktop applications, you can contribute to this project. Read CONTRIBUTING.md for further tips on contributing.
