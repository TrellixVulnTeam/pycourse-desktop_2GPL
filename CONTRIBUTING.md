# Contribution guidelines for anyone who wants to try this out
In case you are interested in trying using Python with PyQt for developing desktop applications, you are welcome to contribute to this project by creating your own mini-tool or desktop program and adding it to this collection! Here is how to do it.

## Check the prerequisites
Before you get started, check that you have Python 3.6 on your computer. You can do this by typing ```python --version``` in your command line. You can check if Python 3 is hiding behind your Python 2 by writing ```python3 --version```. In case you don't have Python 3.6 installed, you can easily download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). 

You can use an IDE or editor of your choice. This project, however, is built in PyCharm. If you are new to working with Python, I recommend you use this IDE. You can download the free community edition from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

Note that for using PyQt you will need to download both SIP and PyQt5. In PyCharm, you can take care of this in the Settings navigation.

## Get a copy of this code
You can clone a version of this code by running ```git clone ...``` in your command line. The first time you run the code from the IDE, you will have to specify the interpreter version. We use the 3.6 interpreter. 

## Feel like you did something useful?
When you feel happy with the changes you made or the new files you created, you can get them added to this project by creating a pull request. Someone else will review what you did and merge your changes into this origin/master branch!
